This is a minorly updated program I wrote during my summer 2017 research. It's been updated slightly so it works with Wolfram Player. 

However, it is a bit weird about coloring when played using the Wolfram Player: make sure the box labeled "Plot Points" contains a value (the default is 100) so that it works properly
